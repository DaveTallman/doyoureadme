Things to think about as I move from partial db to full db.

1) Modularity and command-line control. I need some options here.
   a) Choice about legacy, monthly, or both in the main part.
   b) Choice about user name for aoi, possibly set in the db as a default.
      Assume for now we only need one, captured the first time.
      This is a big one. Cannot deliver without this option.
   c) More unit-test driven
   d) More modular
   e) Use of logging facility, maybe.
   f) Specify db name on the command line, also.
